        The phenomenon of physicality / awareness of one’s body / arises directly from the sensory experience of a person, from his perception of his body and himself, embodied in the body. One of the main functions of physicality is the ability to navigate the picture of the world and the ability to control your actions.

    <h1>But what is it?</h1>
    <h2>WHAT is meant by such wonderful words as </br>
        “Body-oriented psychology”? </br>
        And "Body-emotional osteopathy" is this all about? <br>
        WHAT I can say is just how I understand this for myself and why I am doing this.</h2>

 
     <h5 class="aboutme">My 10 year journey brought me here. Solving my problems and looking for answers to my questions, I  realized that there is no mono-teaching or direction capable of giving the answers I need. 
        I will explain. Being engaged only in the health of the body and without going through comprehension and awareness, you cannot achieve inner harmony. And going into spirituality and neglecting  bodily needs, you end up with  weakness and illness. It is both an internal and external path of development. 
        The truth in the middle. And for myself, I defined it with the concept of “corporeality”.</h5>


        <h2>I work with the physicality of a person. And what's that?</h2>
        <h5>The phenomenon of physicality is more complex than the flesh. These two concepts are inextricably linked and are components of something whole. Physicality is a big part. The flesh  can be determined through detection of boundaries. Physicality is not limited. It is formed  and exists in much more complex patterns, such as, for example, the concept of “spiritualization of the flesh”.</h5>

<h3><span>Physicality</Span> is not so much the skill of owning one’s body, but to a greater extent it is the experience of interacting with the surrounding World, realizing itself in one’s body. 
    And realizing your body as an integral part of the surrounding World.</h3>

    The body is a set of ratings and comparisons. It is easily integrated into the matrix of meanings and characteristics of one’s or others’s beliefs. And we always evaluate our body with a look from the outside. And often these imposed meanings disfigure our body. Encouraging us to be someone who we really are not.

But corporeality is revealed only from within; this is knowledge of the whole self. True knowledge and deeply inner.

The path to this knowledge, its disclosure in itself and its filling liberates from everything “not ours”, from everything imposed from the outside, from everything that fetters, restricts and disfigures.</h3>
